    "## Food for thought: how to eat sustainably\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note to reader\n",
    "This is a very rough draft. The order and layout is nowhere near final; some visualizations will be made more compact using subplots and interactivity, some visualizations will be drastically altered or left out entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the face of growing concerns about environmental sustainability, understanding the impact of our food choices has become paramount. This data story aims to scientifically examine the sustainability of various food sources, taking into account crucial factors like CO2 emissions, water usage, and the distinction between local and global production. By presenting this information concisely and incorporating charts and plots, our goal is to provide accessible insights that empower individuals to make informed decisions for more sustainable food consumption practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant debate centers around whether local or global food production is more environmentally preferable. Advocates of the local perspective argue that transportation emissions significantly contribute to the carbon footprint of our food. They stress the importance of reducing the distance between farm and table to enhance sustainability. Conversely, proponents of the global perspective emphasize evaluating the environmental impact of different food types, such as animal products versus plant-based alternatives. Metrics like calories or protein produced per unit of emissions are considered crucial in this evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To comprehensively assess the sustainability of food sources, this data story will analyze a range of common options. Environmental impact will be examined across multiple dimensions, including CO2 emissions, water usage, and the balance between local and non-local production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset and preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we used can be downloaded from https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq0216. It is called 'aaq0216_datas1.xls'. The dataset encompasses variables such as land use (in m2), greenhouse gas emissions (in kg CO2-eq), eutrophication (in kg PO43-eq) and freshwater (in liters), for 43 different agricultural products. The dataset is an xls file containing multiple Excel sheets. \n",
    "\n",
    "To look at the global totals of Greenhouse gas emissions for each product, for example, we can look at the following dataframe:"

    "### Brief description of arguments (only for draft)\n",
    "Debate 1: Emissions vs Other Factors\n",
    "\n",
    "Perspective 1: Greenhouse Gas Emissions\n",
    "- Argument 1: Emphasizing the Carbon Footprint\n",
    "  - This argument highlights the importance of considering greenhouse gas emissions as the primary sustainability factor when evaluating food sources.\n",
    "- Argument 2: Comparative Emissions Analysis\n",
    "  - This argument suggests comparing the emissions produced by different food sources to identify the most environmentally friendly options.\n",
    "- Visualization 1: Amount of freshwater withdrawals per nutritional units\n",
    "  - This visualization illustrates the disparity in water usage per nutritional unit across various food sources, highlighting the substantial water footprint associated with nuts and cheese compared to plant-based alternatives. It supports the argument that emissions should be a primary consideration when evaluating sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perspective 2: Multiple Sustainability Factors\n",
    "- Argument 1: Holistic Sustainability Assessment\n",
    "  - This argument advocates for considering factors beyond emissions, such as land use, in order to assess the overall sustainability of food sources.\n",
    "- Argument 2: Environmental Impact Analysis\n",
    "  - This argument emphasizes the need for a comprehensive evaluation of food production's broader environmental consequences.\n",
    "- The plan is for Visualisation 3 to support this perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Debate 2: Global vs Local Sourcing\n",
    "\n",
    "Perspective 1: Importance of Local Production\n",
    "- Argument 1: Emissions from Food Transportation\n",
    "  - This argument highlights the significant emissions generated during the transportation of food and advocates for reducing them through local sourcing.\n",
    "- Argument 2: Total Emissions Reduction\n",
    "  - This argument asserts that prioritizing local production can contribute to a substantial reduction in the overall emissions associated with food consumption.\n",
    "- Visualization 4: Scatter plot of global production and greenhouse gas emissions\n",
    "  - This visualization demonstrates the correlation between high global production and lower emissions per kilogram, supporting the argument that producing food locally can help reduce emissions.\n",
    "- Visualization 5: Bar chart of transport emissions per product\n",
    "  - This visualization highlights the significant CO2 costs associated with food transport, supporting the argument that sourcing locally can reduce emissions. However, it may require further refinement to enhance its effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perspective 2: Food Type Matters\n",
    "- Argument 1: Evaluation of Food Choices\n",
    "  - This argument emphasizes the importance of considering the type of food consumed, particularly distinguishing between animal-based and plant-based products.\n",
    "- Argument 2: Transport Emissions Comparison\n",
    "  - This argument suggests evaluating the emissions associated with food transport in order to make informed choices about sourcing.\n",
    "- Visualization 2: Sunburst figures of vegan vs non-vegan emissions\n",
    "  - These figures visually depict the stark contrast in land use and greenhouse gas emissions between vegan and non-vegan products. By showcasing the impact of food choices on multiple sustainability factors, it supports the argument that evaluating the type of food consumed is essential.\n",
    "- Visualization 6: Animated bar chart of transport emissions per product compared to other types of emissions\n",
    "  - This visualization demonstrates the proportion of greenhouse gas emissions attributed to transport for each food type, emphasizing that transport emissions constitute a small portion of the total emissions. It supports the argument that the type of food consumed is more crucial than the sourcing location.\n",

    "#### fig1: Amount of freshwater withdrawals per nutritional units\n",
    "\n",
    "In figure 1 you can see the different amount of liters water used per nutritional unit. In the figure you can also see that nuts and cheese use alot of water for the amount of nutritions that they give when eating them. Most of the meat substitutes are made from wheat, soy and different kinds of fungi(https://www.milieucentraal.nl/eten-en-drinken/milieubewust-eten/vleesvervangers/). The figure shows that there is a substantial difference between amount of water used for the different kinds of meat and the water usage from wheat and soymilk. This shows that there is also a large difference in the amount of water used between meat and plant based products. "
