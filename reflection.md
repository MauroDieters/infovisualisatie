Following the feedback session, we improved the legend of the first plot as well as the readability.
We made sure to use a consistent style and color scheme for all figures. 
For each plot, we made sure it relates to an argument that supports one of the perspectives described in the introduction.
Furthermore, we limited any dropdown menus to at most 5 options, and limited the amount of different variables for each individual plot.
Aside from this, we continued working on our data story, adding supportive text to each visualisation and improved on some minor visual details as discussed during the feedback session.
