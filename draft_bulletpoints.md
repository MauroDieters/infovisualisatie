##### Visualisation 1: bar charts of the amount of freshwater used for each product, measured in liters per NU (nutritional unit) or FU (fixture unit)
* Certain food groups, like animal products, require much more freshwater to produce than other groups like vegetables, per nutritional unit.
* Thus, it is more efficient to produce certain food groups than others in terms of freshwater.
* This supports the perspective that different food groups have varying environmental impact, and our food choices could greatly assist in environmental sustainability.

##### Visualisation 2:

##### Visualisation 3:
* Non-vegan products have much higher environmental impact than vegan impact
* This again supports the perspective that different food groups have varying environmental impact, and choosing to produce and consume more vegan products could greatly assist in environmental sustainability.
